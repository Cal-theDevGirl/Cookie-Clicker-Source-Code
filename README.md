Website version loads a bit faster, but can get blocked.<br>
To play from my website go here(probably won't be blocked): https://cal-thedevgirl.github.io/Cookie-Clicker-Source-Code/
Downloadable HTML version loads a bit slower, but cannot get blocked.<br><br>
Lucky you! I actually updated this to a version after 2.048! But will I keep doing it?<br>
